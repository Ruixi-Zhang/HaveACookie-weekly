<H1> About: </H1>
<p> I am a senior in NYU's CS program as well as Tisch's Game Design program. I enjoy front end (particularly react) and want to learn as many new skills as possilbe this coming semester. I also like to play games(I've been running a lot of spelunky recently) and I like making espresso at home</p>

I also play the saxophone, write music, and am working on a game with some friends <a href="https://twitter.com/PocketGuava"> Check out some (very outdated) information about it here!</a>
