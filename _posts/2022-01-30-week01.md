title: Week 1 Getting Started With Open Source
---

<h2>What is open source? Why am I here?</h2>

<p>While there is an offical definition and many other definitions of "Open Source", to me the main essence of the Open Source project format is the freedom of use/modification that users are afforded by the format. This freedom allows project creators to source input and labor from opt in participants across the world, for better or worse. Projects do often benefit from this drop in ad-hoc(users work on individual solutions to individual problems as needed) system as people who are confident with a particular type of task can select tasks in which they are confident in, but this can also result in general disorganization and more work for project organizers. This arises from the need for standardization across the code base/documentation, and moderation that ensures contributors follow said standardization guidelines. The speed of development may also suffer inconsistencies due to each user having a different level of comittment to a project. Over time, these projects can also become very difficult for a new user to approach as they become more complex and there is more variation across the codebase. That being said I think that this asyncrhonus, decentralized style allows for users to come together and pool their strengths to work on more specific, niche projects that many companies wont work on. Personally, my hope is that through this course, I can refine my skills to a point where I can contribute to some of the open source projects that have played a large role in my online growing up, while also keeping my skills sharp for when I join the workforce later this year.

 <h2>Open Source Projects that I enjoy using/Hope to one day contribute to</h2>

 <p>Throughout high school and undergrad I have used many open source projects for a variety of purposes, these are some of the projects that I enjoy the most!</p>


<h3>Helm</h3>
<a href="https://tytel.org/helm/">check it out here</a>
<p>Helm is an open source Synthesizer with a fair degree of modularity and customizability. While its synthesis capabilities alone are very impressive, Helm's streamlined, easy to understand UI and compatibility with the Unity game engine make it standout from other open source software. I personally write video game music and enjoy programming dynamic audio systems in games and Helm's robust Unity integration makes it supremely useful for making complex audio systems in games. It also has markedly better documentation that a lot of other synthesizers, making it easier for new users to learn. </p>

<h3>Pokemon Showdown</h3>
<a href="https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown-client"> check it out here</a>
<p>Pokemon Showdown is an online pokemon battle simulator that I used to play quite a bit when I was younger. It near perfectly replecates the functionality of the games and adds many quality of life features that make it easier to play matches with friends. Over the years it has added support for many new features and at least to me is the best way to play Pokemon. It's code at this point is giant and there is a dizzying amount of protocols in place by its owners to keep things progressing smoothly. While doing some research about it's codebase for this writeup for this project I learned it uses a surpising amount of legacy technology (lots of PHP and Jquery). Someday when I'm much more accustomed with open source dev I'd like to try my hand at contributing to this project to show my appreciation for the countless hours of entertainment it brought me in my friends in high school. </p>

<h3> Kali linux</h3>
<a href="https://www.kali.org/"> check it out here</a>
<p> Kali linux is an Linux distribution with a suite of information security oriented tools (like penetration testing or network stress testing)<. While I personally dont use this very much, it was one of the orignal projects that really got me interested in computers and learning more about how they work (which eventually led to me getting a CS degree). It's documentation is extremely robust and I've heard it has become one of the industry standards for many security professionals. </p>

<h3> Tails </h3>

<a href="https://tails.boum.org/"> check it out here</a>
<p> Tails is another linux distribution which is geared towards maximizing privacy and security. Every time you booot up tails it boots as if it is the first time it has been used, and it has many features to ensure your browsing is untracked by large companies who want to monetize your data. It is small enough to be installed on a USB stick and can boot on most computers. Something I really like about it is that it can even boot on up a system that has been compromised by a virus, which makes it particularly valuable when using a public computer that you dont neccesarily trust. I used to use tails a lot at my local public library. I'd highly reccomend giving this a shot sometime or at least trying DuckDuckGo, which is a (somewhat) more anonymous and less trackable search engine than google.</p>
