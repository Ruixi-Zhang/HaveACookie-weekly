<h2>Open Source, Installation and Picking issues </h2>

<p>Just a brief note as i start, apologies for the slight delay on submission, I had written the following post down but had neglected to submit it last night. </p>

<p>This past week my group and I finished installation and picked out some issues to work on for each of us. Fortunately oppia's team makes it easy to pick things out as they reccomend issues that may be suited to you. I have decided to pick an issue that involves some basic type script and i Think i am pretty well suited to  the task. I have a lot of javasript experience and have located a good reference material for JS. I am looking forward to learning something new as I work on this part of the project. One interesting thing i found was that it was super difficult to get the last bit of installation to work on my windows pc. I had oppia working on my macbook but i had to remove it as my macbook is old and doesnt have enough memory to run the project well. When i went to install it on my windows desktop I ran into a lot of issues with WSL(the windows linux shell). I was also suprised about how much longer it took. That being said, I was fortunate enough to have groupmates who had experienced similar issues so they could help me pretty effectively. Going into the next week i hope to get ahead on working on my issue so i can spend some extra time helping out my groupmates to return the favor/</p>
