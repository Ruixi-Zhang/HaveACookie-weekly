<h2>Calloway and starting open source projects</h2>

<p>This week Tom calloway, a former redhat open source employee and current AWS open source lead, discussed the role of open source in business and how it generates money. Personally i found it interested how companies approached maintaining a relationship with a project and would be interested to learn more about sitautions where it didnt neccesarily work out (like the elastic search situation). It seems difficult to come across as trustworthy as a huge corporation like AWS. That being said, its seems like while this sector of open source is more profit motivated, it can produce good for open source communities as companies are trying to help compensate the developers in some way which is a great thing. I hope this type of trend continues inthe future so the next generation of open source developers thrive.</p>
<h2>Project Groups 1</h2>

<p>This week we officially formed groups and started trying to contriubte to open source projects. My group decided to work on oppia, an open source education platofrm as it has a very robust github and seems to be very organized and suited for new contributors(with lots of easy looking issues and opportunities ot make a contribution). So far installation went pretty well and currently we are looking to find potential issues that would be manageable for us to work on. Hopefully things continue to progress smoothly.</p>
